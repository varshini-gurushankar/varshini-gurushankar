## hello world!

### about me:

I am Varshini Gurushankar, currently an incoming junior at UC Davis studying Computer Science. Iâ€™m passionate about building impactful projects that blend technology and real-world usability. I enjoy experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and tech stacks â€” so far, Iâ€™ve worked with **Python**, **Java**, **ReactJS**, **JavaScript**, and **Swift**. I'm especially interested in AI/ML applications and building projects around it. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time at the beach, playing badminton, and exploring new genres of music.
